# [COMMAND-SYSTEM]
<details>
<summary>üòò How does this system currently work?</summary>
<br>

This system allows celeste to run custom code when someone gives her a specified voice command, very simple system that allows for some more user interactivity.

If a keyword of a command is said within the first three words then it will activate it, using following words as variables.

>**EX: ["play list", "celeste play list"] would activate the "play" command with the the variable as "list".**
