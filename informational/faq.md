## HOW DID CELESTE COME TO BE?
Originally back when I created Celeste, she wasn't really meant to be a robot that could talk to people at all, she was originally meant to be a "prop bot", IE a bot that was capable of spawning in props to be placed in specific locations on a map, thus creating a fun and unique experience whenever it was in your lobby, over time as I kept adding onto it, it kept improving and then the scope changed to what we have today, and theres still a ton more areas I want to explore, as I also use celeste as a learning-project ontop of experimenting crazy and wacky ideas.

## SHES NOT MAKING SENSE! SHE IS BROKEN!

⚠️ **Abuse of this function could lead to moderation action.**

If Celeste doesn't seem to be making sense, sometimes saying "reset" may put her back on a more stable track, this basically forces her to wipe her current chat session.

⚠️ **Abuse of this function could lead to moderation action.**




**⬇️ IF SHE DOES ANY OF THIS, SHE MAY BE ACTUALLY BROKEN! ⬇️**
* Not responding to visual or auditorial data.
* Chatbubbles not working.

Otherwise this just wastes my time and causes unnecessary stress.

## WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES DO YOU KNOW?
* Python **(Celeste-AI is written in Python)**
* Lua

## IS SHE OPEN SOURCE?
**TLDR:** <ins>Not interested in it for now.</ins>

### More in-depth answer:
* Due to me actively still working on her, I do not wish to open source her at this time.

* There is some technology on celeste that could be heavilly abused by people and I'd rather not open that can of worms myself.

* I'm not fully against open sourcing some small stuff, but if I do it will be what I think is safe and fine for myself and the community as a whole, I will not be pressured into open-sourcing what I don't feel comfortable with, however I am also willing to give pointers to people when requested.

## WHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU SUPPORT?
* English **(MAIN LANGAUGE)**
* Japanese **(NOT UTILIZED YET)**
* Chinese **(NOT UTILIZED YET)**

## WHAT KIND OF DATA DO YOU COLLECT?
* **Currently we do not collect data past what is needed to function**

⚠️ **Currently, audio data is mostly used for transcription which is cleaned up with post-processing and downsampled for our service to be able to try and figure out what the person talking to her is trying to say to her, visual data is also used for object detection, prediction math, and various other small calculations.**

⚠️ **This can change at anytime, when using our service you understand that we can use the data as we see fit, however we do believe in privacy in most cases so we try not to overstep unless absolutely neccessary, example being moderation, you are constantly being monitored by our software, and if you should break our TOS and or the platform that she is currently on, you will be moderated and possibly reported to the appropriate mod teams of said platform, potentially even being barred from our services and or servers if need be.**

## IS EVERYTHING SHE SAYS YOUR VIEWS?
Whilst we joke that "anything she says is canon", that is far from the truth.
Celeste-AI is a LLM that can be a bit unpredictable at times, whilst we may be able to guide her personality slightly, in most cases whilst talking to her, you're at the mercy of her currently processes at the time, your experience may differ radically compared to someone elses.

## ARE YOU THE GOVERNMENT?
We are a community-driven initiative that operates independently from any government organization. While we strive to create an enjoyable environment where humor is shared, it is important to note that we do not have any affiliations or governance by official bodies.
