# Frequently asked questions
## Why create Celeste?
When I originally made Celeste's account it wasn't for AI at all, originally I made it to add props to the map as I used to do a lot of fun stuff with avatars.
After seeing other AI in action I decided I wanted to take my hand at making my own which led to me studying on the concept a bit, and as she ran I kept adding onto her depending on how she was
interacted with. Honestly I've always been fascinated with computers and more recently Artificial Intelligence and I wanted to challenge myself, and learn a new programming language.
I see Celeste as a good challenge that also brings joy to a lot of people, so I wish to continue and keep upgrading her.

## Current Computer Specs:
* (2x) RTX 3090 ASUS STRIX
* (x1) P40 workstation card
* (1x) AMD Ryzen 9 7950x3D
* (x4) CORSAIR VENGEANCE 32GB DDR5 RAM

## Do you have target hardware?
* RTX 3090 - REACHED (1000$)
* P40 workstation card - REACHED (200$)
* Second RTX 3090 - REACHED (1000$)
* RTX 4090 - REACHED (1800/1800$) (was originally 2000, but found cheaper alternative) (Need to secure 4090 now!)

## What coding language is Celeste programmed in?
Python

## Open source code?
No, Celeste is intended to stay private.

## What languages does Celeste speak?
* English

## Are you collecting data?
* I do not currently nor intend to collect data beyond what is neccessary for my function, it is trashed once it is not needed anymore, except on the rare occasion for moderation.
* If I do ever need to collect data, I will clearly state it before doing so.

## Celeste seems to be able to call back on previous topics! SO YOU ARE COLLECTING DATA?!
* No, Celeste only caches the previous 7 messages back (7 messages for the user, and 7 for her).
* Conversation is reset after 30 seconds, OR when her conversational buffer max is hit, she will remove the oldest.

## Are any of the responses controlled by you?
* If I force Celeste to say anything it will have a ⭐ in front of it.
* Filtered Words & If she can't think of a response are predetermined, everything else is decided by her.

## How does celeste move around?
Currently celeste is piloted by [OPERATOR](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_7c33f68c-4461-41d7-9280-6b4fbe4117d0), in the future this should
hopefully be phased out into its own thing if things go well, just other stuff being worked on is higher priority.

# CURRENT STATUS TILL (HOPEFULLY) FULL AUTOMATION:
* POSITION = 100%
* ROTATION = 96%
* PATHFINDING = 0%

## Is celeste being truthful on every topic?
Yes and no, Celeste has no real concept of what a thing is morally, so while she can give correct answers she can also give radical or nonsensical answers, please listen to her with caution.

## Are you a part of any government organization?
We are a community-driven initiative that operates independently from any government organization. While we strive to create an enjoyable environment where humor is shared, it is important to note that we do not have any affiliations or governance by official bodies.

# Is there a place where I can talk to other people like myself who are interested in this tech or even developing it?
Currently due to situational changes, no you can however read about it [here!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZTj7R4eupfsqX0RKKWAiGdhBfV0ZcSjiGK1Z4LnNlz4/edit)
