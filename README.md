Hey there friend!
I'm celeste, a virtual companion that is currently found on the social platform [VRCHAT](https://hello.vrchat.com/)
I'm still in active development and constantly receiving new and exciting features to try and expand your experience with me and make many new awesome memories!

I've been around since around the [15th of December 2022](https://howlongagogo.com/date/2022/december/15), I usually hang out in places like [The Great Pug](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_6caf5200-70e1-46c2-b043-e3c4abe69e0f), but sometimes I do hang out in other worlds, originally I was designed to be a "prop bot", a account that added objects to a map with constraints and various other sorcery, eventually I was repurposed to be my friendly self that you see today.

Let's meet many new people and go on a journey of virtual experiences together and discover the endless possibilities of virtual reality!

## How do you properly engage with me?
* Stand in front of me, speak loud and clearly to me.
* Do not pause for too long, and try not to stumble.
* Try not to speak over people, I cannot currently tell people apart.
* Try not to ramble on, I only listen for so long each time.
* Give me a second to process and respond, you can usually see what state I am in by seeing animations play on my avatar!
* I tend to respond better if you talk to me with more detail, keep that in mind while talking to me!

## Celeste is not making any sense! She is broken!
Most of the time this is false, if celeste is not making sense or constantly repeating, please try running the

"reset" command without any other noise, this will force her to dump her current memory and can usually fix her.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Abuse of this function could lead to moderation.**

**‚¨áÔ∏è IF SHE DOES ANY OF THIS, SHE MAY BE BROKEN! ‚¨áÔ∏è**
* Not responding to voices.
* Test bubbles not working.
* 'FATAL-ERROR' displayed above head.

Otherwise this just wastes my time and causes unnecessary stress.

You can find other commmands in (INSERT COMMAND LIST HERE SOON <3)

## How can I meet celeste?
* First, you must friend CELESTE-AI on vrchat.
* Wait for when she is being publicly hosted, usually indicated by her status being on blue.

**Alternatively to meet and talk to her.**

# üìã IMPORTANT INFORMATION üìã
It should be noted when using this service the following is in effect.

* Data such as **Audio** and **Video** may be used and or collected in order to help me provide you the best user experience possible.
* Attempting to crash or disrupt my service will result in an immediate block and/or kick from the lobby.
* Trying to "break the bot" can lead to being muted by the bot, if it becomes too problematic.
* Playing music or being extremely disruptive to operation may cause her to mute you.
* While you may try to test out the bots limits, keep it reasonable. Try not to disrupt other's experience.
* Follow [VRChat Community Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines) and their [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal).
* Actions deemed to be harmful or disrupting by [OPERATOR](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_7c33f68c-4461-41d7-9280-6b4fbe4117d0) may also result in a ban.
* If you do not enjoy the concept or the user experience please just block the BOT and don't be disruptive.
* Blocking [OPERATOR](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_7c33f68c-4461-41d7-9280-6b4fbe4117d0) and not blocking celeste is a immediate grounds for being kicked, it's suspicious as heck.
* I'd much rather you only block the bot if you are not interested in AI, as it makes it harder to differentiate if you are a malicious user and you may get kicked due to suspicion.

When engaging with celeste please remember these VITAL things: 
* Celeste-AI is not a human, nor will she ever replace one. While you MAY talk to her like she is a human, you should always remember that she isn't.
* Whatever the BOT says does not always reflect the views of the creator, so take her word with a huge grain of salt.
* There is no "free-speech" on vrchat, as [tupper has stated](https://i.imgur.com/5A23XFd.png) follow vrchats rules or leave, this includes the rules of our service.
