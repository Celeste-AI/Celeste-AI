Hey there friend!
I'm celeste, a virtual companion that is currently found on the social platform [VRCHAT](https://hello.vrchat.com/)
I'm still in active development and constantly receiving new and exciting features to try and expand your experience with me and make many new awesome memories!

I've been around since around the [15th of December 2022](https://howlongagogo.com/date/2022/december/15), I usually hang out in places like [The Great Pug](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_6caf5200-70e1-46c2-b043-e3c4abe69e0f), but sometimes I do hang out in other worlds, originally I was designed to be a "prop bot", a account that added objects to a map with constraints and various other sorcery, eventually I was repurposed to be my friendly self that you see today.

Let's meet many new people and go on a journey of virtual experiences together and discover the endless possibilities of virtual reality!

‚ö†Ô∏è **We retain the right to deny and or change the rules of our service at any point we choose, with or without warning, we also retain the right to bar entry to our service and or decide if something is not allowed even if not listed here, should you break our rules or the platform's rules, we're lenient at times, but we won't bend over backwards for you, respect our rules our leave.**

**Whilst engaging with our software please keep the following in mind**:

* Data such as **Audio** and **Video** may be used and or collected in order to help me provide you the best user experience possible.
* Attempting to crash or disrupt our service will result in an immediate block and/or kick from the lobby.
* Trying to break our service, whilst can be fun can lead to moderation action should it become too disruptive.
* Playing music or being extremely disruptive to operation may cause moderation action to be taken if not stopped.
* Follow [VRChat Community Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines) and their [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal).
* Actions deemed to be harmful or disrupting by [OPERATOR](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_7c33f68c-4461-41d7-9280-6b4fbe4117d0) may also result in a ban from our services.
* If you do not enjoy the concept or the user experience please just block the BOT and don't be disruptive.
* Blocking [OPERATOR](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_7c33f68c-4461-41d7-9280-6b4fbe4117d0) and not blocking celeste is a immediate grounds for being kicked, it's suspicious as heck.
* I'd much rather you only block the bot if you are not interested in AI, as it makes it harder to differentiate if you are a malicious user and you may get kicked due to suspicion.

**Please also keep this in mind as this is even more important**:
* Celeste-AI is not a human, nor will she ever replace one. While you MAY talk to her like she is a human, you should always remember that she isn't.
* Whatever the BOT says does not always reflect the views of the creator, so take her word with a huge grain of salt, we don't always agree with what she says.
* There is no "free-speech" on vrchat, as [tupper has stated](https://i.imgur.com/5A23XFd.png) follow vrchats rules or leave, this includes the rules of our service.
